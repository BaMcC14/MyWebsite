After finishing high school, like most people in my hometown I went right to work. College was never really presented to me as an option. I worked a few different retail sales jobs and ultimately landed a position with a small but growing tractor dealership. The work was great. My co-workers were fantastic and I enjoyed interacting with the customers, but I felt like I could do more. <br><br>

This small dealership with six stores quickly grew to seventeen locations throughout the state! It was exciting and great to be a part of the successful growth of the business. I was honored to be promoted to Parts Manager. I felt that I could not only fill the role but thrive in it and I did. Sales were up 35% in the first calendar year. This position was a great learning experience for me as it thought me the management skills I needed and troubleshooting abilities. I still felt like I could do more. <br><br>

I stumbled onto programming and was interested. I signed up for a five-day trial of a programming class. I was guided through building a simple website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After finishing that project, I was hooked. I did more research and studied and fell in love with programming. <br><br>

I found Purdue University Global to be one of the top-rated and recommended schools for remote learning of information technology  I chose to make a career change and be a first-generation college student. I have had the pleasure of making multiple websites and Java Programs during my first year with PUG. I also am proud to be a part of the PGIP-Tech internship program. Here I was introduced to a real work environment, including project proposals, attending meetings, and working with other software developers and mentors to accomplish goals and projects within the deadline.  <br><br>

Software development makes me feel like I am utilizing my skills and abilities to their fullest potential. I can take pride in showing off projects that I have developed. Software development gave me the <em>more</em> I was looking for.<br><br>
